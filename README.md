### About Me

Welcome! I'm a Data Scientist living in the greate city of Chicago, IL who is constantly seeking to evolve. Priding myself with extensive experience in Python, Statistics, Mathematics, Machine Learning, Database Management, and much more. This pride carries into how I set myself up for success with each project I work on. I take the angle of not just telling a story with the data, but to actually find actionable insight that can leverage data (no matter how it looks). My higher educational path began with an Bachelors of Science from Butler University in Statistics and Data Science, follwed by a Masters of Science in Data Science from Bellevue University. To keep my evolution you know, evolving, I'm currently getting a Professional Certification in AI and Machine Learning from a top program (Purdue University with IBM). All of these educational experiences have sharpened me up to create some very advanced models with Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, and much more. These experiences also gave me the **superpower** of not just knowing how to code these advanced models, but to know what they are actually doing mathematically.

The industries that I enjoy are **Fintech, Quantitative positions, Tech, and E-Commerce**. 

In my personal projects, **when I am coding**, I'm usually building some sort of predictive model (Regression, Tree based models, Neural Networks), doing some annomaly detection, looking at how I can discover opportunity in the stock market/sports betting, or anything that would relate to an idea or interest of mine. Things that interest me usually ends up with me finding data related to this interest, and taking a deep dive into it.

**When I am not coding**, I'm either out running or working out 🏃, at a movie theater 🎥, golfing (weather permitting) ⛳, or hanging out with the people I love.

This section, yes, is about me... but a skill outside of the technical pieces I have and enjoy is to connect. I am always available to talk about Data Science, various industries, or anything. Check out my contact information below to connect.

### Recent Experiences

Currently, I work as a Marketing Data Scientist where I utilize many different Data Science and ML methods to help the teams at the company. Working with Sales, Marketing, and Operations teams; I had to learn the company and all the data we have available. My typical work consists of data cleaning, model building (classification and predictive models) to help discover opportunity for the marketing and sales orgs.

Before my current role, I was an Analyst working deep with Healthcare data. I dealt with millions of claims at a time where I would utilize SQL and Python to clean, explore, and produce reports that would drive decision making across many cross-functional teams. I did end up leaving this opportunity however because of the industry. I have a huge appreciation for Healthcare, but, as I listed above, Fintech, Finance, and Tech are where I find my passion. This role did give me experience that I have been able to transfer to my current role and personal projects.

Furthermore, I've linked my Resume at the bottom of this page if you'd like to check out other experiences as well.

## Contents

Within this portfolio you will find some of my favorite projects (located in the 'Projects' folder, or click [here](https://github.com/ccouger/ccouger.github.io/tree/main/Projects)) throughout my data science journey. A lot of these are consisted of work I did in my graduate program when obtaining my MS in Data Science. I'm proud of these projects and am glad they can represent my enjoyment for data science and all the different techniques I enjoy. Please give a look to the other README files as they give some good insight to what each project is. Thank you!
